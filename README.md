## Project

Proj_Izh_1cell_test_1.py
Test a single Izhikevich neuron

Proj_Izh_1cell_weight_sel.py
Probe various synaptic weights and plot PSP's

Proj_Izh_1cell_NetStim_xei_1.py
Single neuron with two NetStim inputs acting via AMPA and GABAA respectively

Proj_Izh_1cell_ICnoise_1.py
Single neuron with white-noise input acting via IClamp

Proj_Izh_1cell_SynNoise_1.py
Single neuron with white-noise input acting via ExpSynD (a modification of ExpSyn)
Two noise inputs are delivered via AMPA and GABAA respectively
Noise parameters are derived in such a way that the result matches the one of Proj_Izh_1cell_NetStim_xei_1.py
